# Packet Sniffer with Threat Detection usage

Open any browser or ping a site â€” the sniffer will pick up packets.

Or open a terminal and run something like:

curl http://example.com

If you're checking specific ports (e.g. SSH, Telnet):

nc 127.0.0.1 22

The tool logs/detects the connection â€” simple test case.
